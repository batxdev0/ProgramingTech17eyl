A C program manages the activity of a hair salon. Each service performed in the salon is represented by the 
following struct:  
 
typedef struct {  
    char operatorID[10];    // Alphanumeric ID of the operator  
    char date[11];          // Date of the service in dd/mm/yyyy format  
    float revenue;          // Revenue from the perfomed service (in euro)  
} Service;  
 
It is assumed that the data related to services carried out during the January–April 2025  period (at most 500 
records) are stored in a text file, whose name is passed as a command -line argument.  
The main function of the program is as follows:  
 
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {  
    char* month Names[] = {"January", "February", "March", "April"};  
    Service serviceList[500];  
    int nServices;  
    nServices = readServices(argv[1], serviceList, 500);  
    printf("The month with the highest total revenue is %s \n",               
       monthNames[bestMonth (serviceList, nServices)]);  
    printf("The ID of the operator who performed the most expensive service is  
       %s\n", bestOperator (serviceList, nServices));  
    return 0;  
} 
 
Knowing that:  
- the function readServices reads the data from the input file and stores it in the array serviceList,  
returning the total number of services  (assume it is higher than 0 and lower or equal to 500).  
- the first printf  prints a message showing the name of the month with the highest total revenue . 
(assume that all services are within the January –April 2025 period, that all dates are correctly formatted, 
and there are no ties);  
- the second printf prints a message showing the ID of the operator who performed the most expensive 
individual service (assume there are no ties);  
you are required to implement the functions bestMonth  and bestOperator . The return types, as well as the 
number , order,  and types of the formal parameters, must be inferred based on how the functions are invoked in 
main.  
 
NB. You are asked  to implement only the  two  required functions . YOU CANNOT use dynamic allocation, or 
variable length arrays!  
 
int bestMonth (Service services[], int n) {  
    float monthlyRevenue[4] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}; // For Jan to Apr  
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {  
        int month;  
        sscanf(services[i].date, "%*d/%d/%*d", &month);  
        monthlyRevenue[month - 1] += services[i].revenue;  
    } 
    int best = 0;  
    for (int i = 1; i < 4; ++i) {  
        if (monthlyRevenue[i] > monthlyRevenue[best]) {  
            best = i;  
        } 
    } 
    return best;  
} 
 
 7 char* bestOperator (Service services[], int n) {  
    int maxIndex = 0;  
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)  
        if (services[i].revenue > services[maxIndex].revenue) {  
            maxIndex = i;  
    return services[maxIndex].operatorID;  
}
